<h1>Daniel Montalvo</h1>
<p>My name is Daniel Montalvo.I was born and raised in Compton CA. I am 28 years old and have a 2 year old daughter and have been married now for 6 years. I have a courier company that I have started but it isn't my dream. I started my college career in East Los Angeles College originally as a kinesiology major. I then transfered to Cerritos College and started pursing Engineering Design Technology. I received my AA and three certificates in Engineering Design Technology from Cerritos College. Now I am pursuing my AA in CIS Programmer. I hope to be able to finish by the summer of 2024.</p>
